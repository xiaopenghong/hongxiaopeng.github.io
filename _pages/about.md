* I am now an Associate Professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 
* I received my Ph.D. degree in computer application and technology from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, P. R. China, in 2010. 
* I was a Docent with the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis, University of Oulu, Finland, where I had been a scientist researcher from 2011 to 2018. 
* I have published over 30 articles in mainstream journals and conferences such as IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-IP, IEEE CVPR, and ACM UbiComp, and have one issued Chinese Patent, with a total Google Scholar citation over 660, an H-index =15 and an H10-index = 19. I have (co-)organized one journal special issue and three international workshops, and served as a reviewer for about 30 journals (such as IEEE TPAMI, TIP, and Springer IJCV) and conferences (such as IEEE CVPR, ICCV, and ACM MM). I have advised or been advising six Ph.D. students since 2012 as a technical supervisor in Oulu University, Finland. I have been a PI of an Infotech Oulu Postdoctoral funding project and the project manager of an Academy of Finland ICT 2023 funding project (also the only co-writer of that proposal). 
* My current research interests include the deep learning technology and other machine learning methods, especially their applications in multi-modal learning, affective computing, intelligent medical examination, and human-computer interaction, and so forth. Global media have reported my research including MIT Technology Review and Daily Mail.
