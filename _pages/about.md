* I am now an <i> Distinguished Research Fellow </i> at <i>Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University</i>. 
{: .notice--primary}
* I received my Ph.D. degree in computer application and technology from <i>Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, P. R. China</i>, in 2010.
{: .notice--info} 
* I have become a <i>Docent</i> with <i>the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS), University of Oulu, Finland, since March, 2018 </i>, where I had been a scientist researcher from 2011 to 2019. 
{: .notice--info} 
* I have published over 50 articles in mainstream journals and conferences such as IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-IP, IEEE CVPR, IEEE ICCV, AAAI, and ACM UbiComp, and have one issued Chinese Patent, with a total Google Scholar citation over 2100, an H-index =24 and an H10-index = 40. Global media have reported my research including MIT Technology Review and Daily Mail.
